When I was younger, I was convinced that I wanted to be a screenwriter. My efforts yielded middling results each time: I would write a few pages before losing the thread and despairing. I was often told that writing, and writing badly, was the only way to improve, and that that would mean the first few things I wrote would simply be bad.

I could never internalize that advice. I treated every idea I had as sacred– to consign the first few to the scrap heap of my development as a writer seemed sacrilegious.

As a software engineer, I’m mercifully unburdened of this (in retrospect hilarious and typical) misconception. Which is to say: most of what I produce now is abysmal, and that’s great. Engineers, however, have a more diplomatic way of expressing just _why_ this is great: they just tell you to optimize for volume.

I haven’t been doing this very long, at least not compared to my colleagues, most of whom were coding at the age when I thought I was going to write the Next Great American Screenplay. Optimizing for volume, for me, is a catch-up play: if my more-experienced colleague can immediately find the “correct” solution to a problem and start implementing it, I may flail around and indulge two or three “incorrect” solutions, before finding the correct one and getting to it. If I’m going to do two or three wrong things for every right thing a more senior engineer does, then simple arithmetic dictates that I should produce two or three times as much. That is, incidentally, exactly what I hope to do.

I have designed this site[^1] with optimization for volume in mind. Whereas my previous sites were either business cards or portfolios or blogs, I have very deliberately made this one a hybrid of all three.

Putting together a personal site, I’ve found, is actually incredibly difficult, and it’s party an issue of map/territory: I haven’t created very much, so any site I put together is a promissory note for work I’ll create in the future. Since I don’t want to have to remake the site once I produce the work, the act of making the site is also the act of predicting exactly what I’ll be doing and how I want that represented.

This attempt, then, is centered around twelve projects, each of which exists today[^2]. I will be tackling each of these projects in turn, taking them from wherever they are now to some arbitrary (but good-faith) degree of finished-ness. For each project, I’ll share updates on its creation, both from a high-level, product-management perspective, and from a more technical perspective, as I encounter interesting problems[^3].

An added dimension of this optimization for volume is a dose of good, old-fashioned book learning. For the past few months, I’ve been intermittently reading and working through Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs. I’ve kept up two habits throughout: the taking of obsessive notes, and a stubborn insistence on understanding every single example they cite, most of which comes from college-level math. As someone who managed to go his entire college career without taking a math class, this actually represents a significant outlay of effort. Rather than let this effort go to waste, I will be sharing my notes and any mathematical insight I gain, so that other liberal arts refugees might learn from my example.

The one thing I have not given any thought to is what, exactly, all of this volume will yield. I am, in that regard, a dog chasing cars. Previous attempts at creating a personal site[^4] have failed because I had preoptimized: I had decided too much about _who and what I would be_ when I put them together. With this one, I was extremely fastidious about what exactly I would be doing, but the “why” of it is immaterial– it’s all just volume.

[^1]: My third attempt at a personal site, incidentally.
[^2]: For some value of “exists.”
[^3]: And hopefully solve them.
[^4]: And this post is basically a “welcome to my new site” post, so I can feel justified and on-topic about bringing them up.
